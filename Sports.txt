The game isn't over until you stop trying.
Champions are built in the moments no one sees.
A loss isn't failure -- it's training.
Keep pushing. Your limits are farther than you think.
Teamwork turns good players into great ones.
Effort beats excuses every time.
You don't need perfect conditions to give perfect effort.
The hardest battles build the strongest athletes.
Every rep, every lap, every drill matters.
Your mindset is your greatest piece of equipment.
Learn from yesterday's game, but don't live in it.
Consistency turns practice into victory.
Sweat today, strength tomorrow.
Every athlete started as a beginner.
Courage is playing your heart out even when you're tired.
Fall forward -- learn something every time you stumble.
Believe in yourself even when the scoreboard doesn't.
You can't control the play, but you can control the effort.
Greatness is built one practice at a time.
Play proud. Win humble.
